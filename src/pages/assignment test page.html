    <p> Prepare a presentation about butterflies life stage which compares to your life.
    <br><br> Description :
    <br>

    In 1979, at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Edward
Lorenz, a meteorologist from MIT, presented a paper on the dynamics of weather systems.
The title of the paper posed an intriguing question: Does the Flap of a Butterfly s Wings in
Brazil Set off a Tornado in Texas? The principle he advanced in this seminal paper was that
predictability on a global level was as uncertain as quantum theory had shown it to <br>
be in the
micro-realm of subatomic particles.
This principle came to be called the Butterfly Effect, and it exemplifies yet another of
contemporary science s departures from the neat and tidy world of Newtonian physics. <br>
In
Newton s scheme of things, equal and opposite reactions are the rule, but with the idea of the
Butterfly Effect, small initial causes can produce momentous consequences.
The Butterfly Effect is thus a powerful metaphor suggesting that the same principle can work
in our lives.
